**Nukit Open Air Purifier-W(all) v1.0**
---
For the wall mount Nukit Open Air Purifier, using anchors and a level, mount it high enough on the wall that no one can sit on it, hang from it, or stack heavy objects on it. Two  units can be mirrored and mounted flush, side by side, with a cable passthrough between them, fed by a single cable entering one unit.
